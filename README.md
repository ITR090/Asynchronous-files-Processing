# Asynchronous Files Processing with React, Node.js, and Google Cloud

This project demonstrates an event-driven, asynchronous file processing pipeline using **React** for the frontend, **Node.js** for the backend, and several **Google Cloud Platform** (GCP) services to handle file upload, resizing, and filtering.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

1. **React Frontend**: Users upload files via a web interface.
2. **Node.js Backend (API)**: 
   - Receives the file from React.
   - Stores the file in a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket.
   - Publishes a message to an existing **Cloud Pub/Sub topic**.
3. **Cloud Pub/Sub**: Relays the file processing task asynchronously.
4. **Cloud Function**:
   - Triggered by the Pub/Sub topic.
   - Downloads the file from GCS.
   - Applies resizing and filtering logic.
   - Saves the processed file to another GCS bucket.

## üöÄ Setup & Deployment

1. Create GCP Account and Enable Billing

2. Deploy Cloud Function


3. Start React Frontend

```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

4. Start Node.js Backend

```
cd server
npm install
npm run start
```
